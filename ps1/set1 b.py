    Find number of eggs to bring back, using the smallest number of eggs. Assumes there is
    an infinite supply of eggs of each weight, and there is always a egg of value 1.

    Parameters:
    egg_weights - tuple of integers, available egg weights sorted from smallest to largest value (1 = d1 < d2 < ... < dk)
    target_weight - int, amount of weight we want to find eggs to fit
    memo - dictionary, OPTIONAL parameter for memoization (you may not need to use this parameter depending on your implementation)

    Returns: int, smallest number of eggs needed to make target weight
